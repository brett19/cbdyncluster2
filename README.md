# cbdinocluster

cbdinocluster is the successor to cbdyncluster.  It's intention is to provide tooling
for the dynamic allocation of clusters on developer machines as well in various CI
environments.

  ```
  brew install docker
  ```

  ```
  brew install colima
  colima start --network-address --cpu 4 --memory 6
  # you can later use `colima stop` to stop it
  ```

    ```
### Using cbdinocluster
